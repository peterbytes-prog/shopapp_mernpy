#Descriptions
Full stack software developed for an online Produce store that regularly updates the catalogue information with data provided by the suppliers via email. The suppliers send the data as a zipped file with large images with an associated description of the products in two files (.TIF for the image and .txt/.csv for the products descriptions and promotions). The images are reformatted to smaller jpeg images. A summary of the data is then saved in the database (MongoDB). Using Python request, the parsed contents of the supplier data are then uploaded to the company's running web service that is created using Node.js, React.js, Express.js and MongoDB. Once the task is complete, the company and the supplier will be notified with an email that summarizes what was uploaded; the email includes a PDF attached with the product details using tables and charts. Finally, in parallel to the automation running, the app runs an operating system health check and sends an email if something goes wrong.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78501918/181847951-cf8903e7-09be-4232-abf0-35ec90b1612a.png)
